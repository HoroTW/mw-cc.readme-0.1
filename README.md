# "Language support" for mwcc-readme files

This adds very crude (honestly I don't know what I did here) language support for the `readme` files from my middle ware cloud computing class at the FAU.

This was manly done to procrastinate from doing my homework. ðŸ¤£

The language support is probably implemented in a completely wrong way (I just used some tokens without paying attention to their meaning) - Also, I didn't read the documentation and for me it was enough that it shows some of the file in color ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.

I only had half an hour to do this, so that and that it's not really needed is my excuse for it being so bad - I had fun skimming it.

## Installation
Since I did for obvious reasons not publish this to the marketplace, you have to install it manually.

To do this just clone this repository into your `~/.vscode/extensions` folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HoroTW/mw-cc.readme-0.1.git ~/.vscode/extensions/mw-cc.readme-0.1
```
